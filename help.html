            <h1>Kanban Definition</h1>

            <p>A kanban board is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit
                work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). It can help both agile and DevOps teams establish
                order in their daily work. Kanban boards use cards, columns, and continuous improvement to help
                technology and service teams commit to the right amount of work, and get it done!</p>
            <br>

            <h2>History</h2>

            <p>The Japanese word “kanban”, meaning “visual board” or a “sign”, has been used in the sense of a process
                definition since the 1950s. It was first developed and applied by Toyota as a scheduling system for
                just-in-time
                manufacturing. On the other hand, the capitalized term “Kanban” is known and associated with the
                emergence
                of
                the “Kanban Method,” which was first defined in 2007.</p>
